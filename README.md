## Hi, I'm Anwar ðŸ‘‹
A Ph.D. student working in the Department of Computer Science at Iowa State University. Currently working in theÂ Software Analytics and Pervasive Parallelism Lab under Dr. Ali Jannesari's co-supervision and in The Real-Time Analytics of Transportation Data lab under the co-supervision of Professor Anuj Sharma. My Ph.D. research topic is optimizing performance and communication in heterogeneous federated and decentralized learning systems. I am working on adapting and improving the capabilities of foundation models in federated learning systems.

I'm best reached via [email](https://mahemon.github.io/). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
